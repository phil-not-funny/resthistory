# Resthistory API
Resthistory API is a one-man project and a collection of historical soveriegn states (I was bored).
Want to make a Trivia including every modern country and countries that died-out? I got you.

### Important:
This app is written in express.js
- /country/all : Returns all Countries
- /country/{id} : Returns a Country by its ID
- /country/{name} : Returns the first Country found that includes the parameter "name"
- /country/random : Returns a random country based on it's rarity (Best for Minigames)
